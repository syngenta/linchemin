    :Release: |version|

The Linked Chemical Information (LinChemIn)
package is a python toolkit that allows cheminformatics operations on synthetic routes and reaction networks.
Wrapping some third-party packages for handling graph arithmetic and cheminformatics and
implementing new data models and functionalities, LinChemIn allows the interconversion between
data formats and data models and enables route-level analysis and operations,
including route comparison and descriptors calculation.
