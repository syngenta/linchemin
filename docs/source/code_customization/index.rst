Code Customization
==================

The LinChemIn's architecture is inspired by the object-oriented design principles.
In particular, modules and functions follow the "single-responsibility" principle to
maximize code reusability, facilitate testing, and support code refactoring.
The deliberate usage of appropriate architectural patterns
ensures that the code is open for extension but closed for modification.
This approach aims to lower the barrier of incorporating external contributions to the code,
thus fostering open and collaborative software development.

Below you can find information about how you can add custom features and expand the main
functionalities of LinChemIn.
