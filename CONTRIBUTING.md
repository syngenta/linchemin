## Contributing to LinChemIn codebase

If you would like to contribute to the package, we recommend the following development setup.

1. Create a copy of the [repository](https://github.com/syngenta/linchemin) via the "_Fork_" button.

2. Clone the linchemin repository:

    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:${GH_ACCOUNT_OR_ORG}/linchemin.git
    ```

3. Add remote linchemin repo as an "upstream" in your local repo, so you can check/update remote changes.

   ```sh
   git remote add upstream git@github.com:syngenta/linchemin.git
   ```

4. Create a dedicated branch:

    ```sh
    cd linchemin
    git checkout -b a-super-nice-feature-we-all-need
    ```

5. Create and activate a dedicated conda environment (any other virtual environment management would work):

    ```sh
    conda env create linchemin
    conda activate linchemin
    ```

6. Install linchemin in editable mode:

    ```sh
    pip install -e .[dev]
    ```

7. Implement your changes and once you are ready run the tests:

    ```sh
    # this can take quite long 
    cd linchemin/tests 
    python -m pytest 
    ```
   
   And add style checks (be aware that running isort might change your files!):
   ```sh
    cd linchemin
    # sorting the imports
    python -m isort src/linchemin
    # checking flake8
    python -m flake8 --ignore E501 src/linchemin
    ```

8. Once the tests and checks passes, but most importantly you are happy with the implemented feature, commit your changes.

    ```sh
    # add the changes
    git add 
    # commit them
    git commit -s -m "feat: implementing super nice feature." -m "A feature we all need."
    # check upstream changes
    git fetch upstream
    git rebase upstream/main
    # push changes to your fork
    git push -u origin a-super-nice-feature-we-all-need
    ```

9. From your fork, open a pull request via the "_Contribute_" button, the maintainers will be happy to review it.
