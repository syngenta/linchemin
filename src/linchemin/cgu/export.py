REMOVEME:
this module contains a nubmer of functionalities required to export a graph into a file, or read from it
(as opposed to translate that works on them in moemory)

This module imports translate, and the necessary IO functions,
here we insert also formats that are necessary for graph visualization

we might neet to re-arrange this module in the future
expecially the interaction with databases, should not belong here, but rather have a dedicated place and strucutre
expample the no4j etl machinery to load data (ex via saving a csv file or interactively) and to extract data
